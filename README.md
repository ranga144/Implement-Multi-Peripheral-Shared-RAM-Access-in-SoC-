# Implement-Multi-Peripheral-Shared-RAM-Access-in-SoC-
This project implements a multi-peripheral shared RAM access system in an SoC using RTL design. It enables multiple peripherals to efficiently access common memory through arbitration, ensuring data integrity, reduced latency, and optimized on-chip resource utilization.
